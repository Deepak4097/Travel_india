<h2>History of Tamilnadu</h2>
<p>Tamil Nadu's history dates back to pre-historic times. Archaeological evidence points to this area being one of the longest continuous habitations in India.In Adichanallur, 24 km (15 mi) from Tirunelveli, archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India unearthed 169 clay urns containing human skulls, skeletons and bones, plus husks and grains of rice, charred rice and Neolithic celts, giving evidence confirming them to be of the Neolithic period, 3800 years ago. The ASI archaeologists have proposed that the script used at that site is "very rudimentary" Tamil Brahmi. Adichanallur has been announced as an archaeological site for further excavation and studies. About 60% of the total epigraphical inscriptions found by ASI in India are from Tamil Nadu and most of which are in Tamil language.
    It is said that what we call as the Kumarikandam and the Lemuria continents as vouched by the European historians are one and the same. Therefore, it is assumed, that the history of Tamils began from the Lemuria era itself. It is further established that the civilisation of the historical sites like Mohanjadero and Harappa are also that of Tamils. The language used there also similar to the ancient one spoken by Tamils. The Archeological findings of Adichanalloor in Tamilnadu in the year 1876 like earthen vessels, golden ornaments, Ornamental brass lamps etc vouch for the fact that the Tamils were equally adept in handling clay as well as various kinds of metals.</p>
