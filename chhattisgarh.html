<h2>History of chhattisgarh</h2>
<p>Raipur district is important in historical and archaeological point of view. This district was once part of Southern Kosal and considered to be under Mourya Kingdom. Raipur city had been the capital of the Haihaya Kings, controlling the traditional forts of the Chhattisgarh for a long time. The town of Raipur has been in existence since the 9th century, the old site and ruins of the fort can be seen in the southern part of the city. Satawahana Kings ruled this part till the 2nd-3rd century AD.

    In the 4th Century AD the king Samudragupta had conquered this region and established his domination till Fifth-Sixth Century AD when this part had come under the rule of Sarabhpuri Kings. For some period in Fifth-Sixth Century A.D., Nala kings dominated this area. Later onSomavanshi kings had taken the control over this region and ruled with Sirpur (Sripur-The city of Wealth) as their capital city. MahashivguptBalarjun was the mightiest emperor of this Dynasty. His mother, the widow Queen of Harshgupta of the Somavansh, Rani Vasata built the famous brick temple of Lakshman. The Kalchuri Kings of Tumman ruled this part for a long time making Ratanpur as capital. The old inscriptions of Ratanpur, Rajim and Khallari refer to the reign of kalchuri kings. It is believed that the King Ramachandra of this dynasty established the city of Raipur and subsequently made it the capital of his kingdom.
    
    Another story about Raipur is that King Ramachandra’s son Brahmdeo Rai had established Raipur. His capital was Khalwatika (Now Khallari) . The newly constructed city was named after Brahmdeo Rai as ‘Raipur’. It was during his time in 1402 A.D. that Hajiraj Naik the temple of Hatkeshwar Mahadev was constructed in the banks of river Kharun.The decline of this dynasty’s rule came with the death of king Amarsingh Deo. This region had become the domain of Bhosle kings after the Amarsinghdeo’s death. With the death of Raghuji the III, the territory was assumed by the British Government from Bhonsla’a of Nagpur and Chhatisgarh was declared a seperateCommissionery with its Headquarters at Raipur in 1854. After independence Raipur district was included in Central Provinces And Berar.
