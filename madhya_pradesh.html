<h2>History of Madhya Pradhesh</h2>
<p>Madhya Pradesh is the second largest Indian Sate in size with an area of 3,08,000 sq.km. 
    Geographically it occupies a pivotal position in the country.
     King Ashoka first among all, ruled over Ujjain. A sizeable portion of Central India was part of the 
     Gupta empire (300-500 A.D.). The Muslims came into Central India in the beginning of 11th century. 
     First of all, Mahmud of Ghazni came over here and then Mohammad Gouri, who incorporated some parts of Central India into his ruling territory of Delhi. Central India was also part of the Mughal empire. During the period between the beginning of the influence of Marathas and the death of Madhoji Scindia in 1794, Marathas were on the ascendant in Central India but later on the small states started coming into existence. These small states became the cause of perpetuation of British power in the country.
     Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, the Gond Maharani Kamalapti and Queen Durgawati, etc., 
    were women rulers whose names have left an indelible imprint on Indian history for their 
    outstanding rule. Madhya Pradesh came into being on 1 November 1956. It was reorganised on 
    1 November 2000 to create a new Chhattisgarh state. The successive state, now, is bounded in 
    north by Uttar Pradesh, east by Chhattisgarh, south by Maharashtra and west by Gujarat and 
    Rajasthan.</p>
