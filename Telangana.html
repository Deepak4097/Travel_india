<h2>History of Telangana</h2>
<p>In the Deccan region, the Kakatiya kingdom (AD 1083-1323) encompassed what is now known as Telangana. After the Kakatiya kingdom was invaded by the Delhi Sultanate, the political autonomy of the region came to an end.
  
  In the course of the next two centuries, it became a province of the Bahmani Sultanate between 1347 and 1518. When the hegemony of the Bahmani Sultanate ended, the Telangana region became part of the Golconda Sultanate (1518-1687).

  With the collapse of Golconda in the face of the invasion of Aurangzeb, the region became a Mughal province. With the dissolution of the Mughal empire formed the Nizamate of Hyderabad. 
  
  This continued from 1720 till 1950 and during this period the region saw various shifts in status - first as a formal subsidiary to the Mughal emperor but actually to the Maratha empire (the first Nizam paid the Chauth tax to the Maratha court at Poona), later allied with the French and then with the English East India Company.
  
  Eventually, the Nizam acknowledged the British sovereign as Empress of India and, thereby, his overlord.
  
  With the India Independence Act of 1947, all the Indian princely states resumed their independence. Accordingly, from August 15, 1947 till September 17, 1948, Hyderabad was an independent state. The independence ended with Indian invasion and annexation. 
  
  Later, the Nizam had been the Rajpramukh (an administrative title) of the Hyderabad state.

  The Nizam officiated as Rajpramukh through the first general election of 1952 and finally gave up his nominal role in 1956 when Hyderabad state was dismembered and the Telangana region annexed to the Andhra state. Thereafter, Telangana witnessed two major movements for a separate statehood. Finally, on October 3, 2013, the Union Cabinet approved the formation of a Telangana state.
